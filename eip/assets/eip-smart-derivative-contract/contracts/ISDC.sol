/**
 * @dev Interface specification for a Smart Derivative Contract, which specifies the post-trade live cycle of an OTC financial derivative in a completely deterministic way.
 * Counterparty Risk is removed by construction.
 *
 * A Smart Derivative Contract is a deterministic settlement protocol which has economically the same behaviour as a collateralized OTC financial derivative.
 * It aims is to remove many inefficiencies in collateralized OTC transactions and remove counterparty credit risk by construction.
 *
 * In contrast to a collateralized derivative contract based and collateral flows are netted. As result, the smart derivative contract generates a stream of
 * reflecting the settlement of a referenced underlying. The settlement cash flows may be daily (which is the standard frequency in traditional markets)
 * or at higher frequencies.
 * With each settlement flow the change is the (discounting adjusted) net present value of the underlying contract is exchanged and the value of the contract is reset to zero.
 *
 * To automatically process settlement, counterparties need to provide sufficient prefunded margin amounts and termination fees at the
 * beginning of each settlement cycle. Through a settlement cycle the margin amounts are locked. Simplified, the contract reverts the classical scheme of
 * 1) underlying valuation, then 2) funding of a margin call to
 * 1) pre-funding of a margin buffer (a token), then 2) settlement.
 *
 * A SDC automatically terminates the derivatives contract if there is insufficient pre-funding or if the settlement amount exceeds a
 * prefunded margin balance. Beyond mutual termination is also intended by the function specification.
 *
 * Events and Functionality specify the entire live cycle: TradeInception, TradeConfirmation, TradeTermination, Margin-Account-Mechanics, Valuation and Settlement.
 *
 * The process can be described by time points and time-intervals which are associated with well defined states:
 * <ol>
 *  <li>t < T* (befrore incept).
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      The process runs in cycles. Let i = 0,1,2,... denote the index of the cycle. Within each cycle there are times
 *      T_{i,0}, T_{i,1}, T_{i,2}, T_{i,3} with T_{i,1} = pre-funding of the Smart Contract, T_{i,2} = request valuation from oracle, T_{i,3} = perform settlement on given valuation, T_{i+1,0} = T_{i,3}.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      Given this time discretization the states are assigned to time points and time intervalls:
 *      <dl>
 *          <dt>Idle</dt>
 *          <dd>Before incept or after terminate</dd>
 *
 *          <dt>Initiation</dt>
 *          <dd>T* < t < T_{0}, where T* is time of incept and T_{0} = T_{0,0}</dd>
 *
 *          <dt>AwaitingFunding</dt>
 *          <dd>T_{i,0} < t < T_{i,1}</dd>
 *
 *          <dt>Funding</dt>
 *          <dd>t = T_{i,1}</dd>
 *
 *          <dt>AwaitingSettlement</dt>
 *          <dd>T_{i,1} < t < T_{i,2}</dd>
 *
 *          <dt>ValuationAndSettlement</dt>
 *          <dd>T_{i,2} < t < T_{i,3}</dd>
 *
 *          <dt>Settled</dt>
 *          <dd>t = T_{i,3}</dd>
 *      </dl>
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
