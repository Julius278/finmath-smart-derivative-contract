## Abstract

The interfaces model the functional transaction scheme to establish a secure delivery-versus-payment
across two blockchains, where a) no intermediary is required and b) one of the two chains
(e.g. the "payment chain") can securely interact with a stateless "decryption oracle".

For convenience, we call the two chains "asset chain" and "payment chain". However, the concept is agnostic to the
nature of the tokens managed on the two chains.

The scheme is realized by two smart contracts, one on each chain.
One smart contract implements the `ILockingContract` interface on one chain (e.g. the "asset chain"), and another smart
contract implements the `IDecryptionContract` interface on the other chain (e.g., the "payment chain").

The smart contract on the asset chain, implementing `ILockingContract`, locks the asset until a key is presented that
will encrypt to a given value.

The smart contract on the payment chain, implementing `IDecryptionContract`, decrypts one of two keys (via the
decryption oracle) conditional to the success or failure of the token transfer initiated
by the method

```solidity
function transferAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, address to, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
```

The contract on the asset chain, implementing `ILockingContract`, will lock the token until a key is presented
releasing the token by calling

```solidity
function transferWithKey(bytes32 id, string memory key) external;
```

where `key` is the decrypted `keyEncryptedSuccess` or `keyEncryptedFailure`

For the decryption, a stateless decryption oracle is attached to the chain running `IDecryptionContract`.

## Motivation

Within the domain of financial transactions and distributed ledger technology (DLT), the Hash-Linked Contract (HLC)
concept has been recognized as valuable and has been thoroughly investigated.
The concept may help to solve the challenge of delivery-versus-payment (DvP), especially in cases where the asset chain
and payment system (which may be a chain, too) are separated. The proposed solutions are based on an API-based
interaction mechanism which bridges the communication between a so-called Asset Chain and a corresponding Payment System
or requires complex and problematic time-locks (\cite{BancaItalia}). We believe an even more lightweight interaction
across both systems is possible, especially when the payment system is also based on a DLT infrastructure.

## Specification

### Methods

#### Smart Contract on one chain (e.g. the asset chain)

```solidity
interface ILockingContract {
    event TransferIncepted(address initiator, bytes32 id);
    event TransferConfirmed(address confirmer, bytes32 id);
    event TokenClaimed(bytes32 id, string key);
    event TokenReclaimed(bytes32 id, string key);

    function inceptTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSeller) external;

    function confirmTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address to, string memory keyEncryptedBuyer) external;

    function transferWithKey(bytes32 id, string memory key) external;
}
```

#### Smart Contract on the other chain (e.g. the payment chain)

```solidity
interface IDecryptionContract {
    event TransferIncepted(address initiator, bytes32 id, int amount);
    event TransferKeyRequested(bytes32 id, string encryptedKey);
    event TransferKeyReleased(bytes32 id, bool success, string key);

    function inceptTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;

    function transferAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, int amount, address to, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;

    function cancelAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
}
```
