****************************************

**Algorithms and methodologies related to smart derivative contracts.**

****************************************

## Introduction

The finmath smart-derivative-contract libraries provides (JVM) implementations of methodologies related to smart
derivative contracts. For a description of the concept of a smart derivative contract
see https://ssrn.com/abstract=3163074

## Contents

### Visualization and Demonstration

The package `net.finmath.smartcontract.demo`contains a visualization of a smart derivative contract.
This is a Java FX application. Run `VisualiserSDC`.

### Valuation Service (ReST service)

Running `mvn spring-boot:run` or runnning `net.finmath.smartcontract.service.Appplication` starts a
ReST service providing a valuation oracle.

The enpoint `https://localhost:8080/valuation/value` allows the valuation of a financial product under given market data.

The enpoint `https://localhost:8080/valuation/margin` allows the calculation of the settlement amount between two market data sets.

The market data has to be provided as a JSON.
The product data as to be provided as an XML (containing a part being an FPML of the underlying product).

See also `api.yml`.

### Settlement Amount Oracle and Valuation Oracle

The package `net.finmath.smartcontract.oracle` contains the interface describing a so called oracle providing the
settlement amount for a smart derivative contract. The package contains also an implementation for interest rate swaps.

### State Machine Model for a Smart Derivative Contract

The package `net.finmath.smartcontract.statemachine` contains a simple state machine modeling a smart derivative
contract.

## Financial Product Description

The smart derivative contract is described in terms of the sdc.xml.
